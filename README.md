**HOW IT WORKS ?**
    
 1. Create  a new deck
 2. Add questions (unlimited number of questions) to the deck
	 a.  Enter the title
	 b.  Add a maximum of four answers for the question. For each answer you create, You need to indicate if it is truthy                 or not in order to get an accurate score after each quiz.
3. You can view the details of the question and their related answers when clicking to a question. In the details screen, you can delete that question with "X" button on the navigation bar located to the right top corner.
4. In the deck details screen, you can start a quiz by clicking the button on the top right corner. If you don't have question in the specific deck, you'll be asked to fill questions first.
5. Once the quiz is done, you'll receive your final score.
6. The score is evaluated based on the following rules:
    		a. Checked answer is marked as true.
    		b. Unchecked one is interpreted as false
    		The score of each question is computed as the natural average of good answers over the total number of the answers
    		c. The score for the quiz is the average of all the scores for the questions over the total number of questions in the deck
